# Contributing

The basic mindset we have for contributing is this. 

I did not find any short web resource explaining this. But I'm sure there is one. 
In case you find it, please put a link here and delety this wordy mess of mine.

## 1. Report the issue

In you find something missing, 
be it a feature, documentation or test, 
please open a [new issue](https://github.com/cta-observatory/dragonboard_testbench/issues)

## 2. Assign yourself

If you want to work on an issue, be it your own issue or somebody elses doesn't matter. 
Please assign yourself to the issue, so everybody knows you are working on it. 

## 3. Feature Branch

Open a little feature branch. Often people struggle finding good names for their branches.
But since you work on an issue, which was already reported, this is easy now. 
Simply call your branch `issue_xxx` wheere xxx is the github number of that issue.

While working on it, you can already push it to there server, no need for secrecy here.
This makes peer reviews possible way before attempting to pull the new feature, bug fix, documentation into the master

## 4. Pull Request and Close Branch

Once you feel you are done. Open a pull request and let us have a look at 
your solution and hopefully pull it into the master right away.

After your solution was pulled, there no need to your branch to continue to exists. So pulled branches are usually deleted. 
This is an act of tidying up and usually feels good. 

## 5. Done

Check out the master and use it ... until you find the next problem.

The goal is to have no open issues and no living feature branches... on average
